# IA_Info-Structuring-Non_Structured_Data

**Project Goal:**
The IA-Info mini project is aimed at structuring unstructured data by extracting essential information from images of individuals, including eye colors,
 gender, age prediction, makeup presence, tattoo identification, and sentiment analysis (happy or sad).

**Project Overview:**
This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract the mentioned information from images with a probability accuracy
 of at least 70%. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface will be created to facilitate easy interaction with the model.

**Data:**
The project utilizes a dataset totaling 460 MB in size, sourced from Kaggle and Google Images. This diverse dataset is crucial for training and evaluating
the model's performance.

**Training and Evaluation:**
The training of the CNN model takes place in Google Colab, with the data stored in Google Drive for accessibility. During the evaluation phase, the model
 demonstrates varying performance, achieving accuracy rates ranging from 85% to 100% on different tasks.

**Application:**
The IA-Info project finds practical applications in both sentimental analysis and targeted advertising. It enables the automatic extraction of valuable
 insights from images, allowing for a more personalized and effective approach to advertising and understanding user sentiment.

**HTML Integration:**
To enhance user interaction, an HTML page will be created using Flask's templating system. Users can upload images, and the system will provide a list of
 predictions for the specified attributes, thereby simplifying the information extraction process.
